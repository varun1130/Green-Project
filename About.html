                  The concept of a “Green Earth” embodies the vision of a planet where nature thrives in harmony with human activities.<br>
                  Greenhouse gases trap some of the heat that results when sunlight heats the Earth's surface. <br>Three important greenhouse gases are shown symbolically in this image: carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane.</h1>

          <div class="content2">
            <p>Take advantage of the free home energy audits offered by many utilities. <br>Then put the recommendations into practice. Simple measures, such as installing a programmable thermostat to replace your old dial unit or sealing and insulating heating and cooling ducts, can each reduce a typical family's carbon dioxide emissions by about 5 percent.<br> Replacing single-paned windows with dual-paned windows and installing insulated doors will also greatly reduce heat loss from your home.</p>

          <div class="content3">
            <p>More than half the electricity in the United States comes from polluting coal-fired power plants. And power plants are the single largest source of heat-trapping gas.<br> Fortunately, the use of alternative energy sources, such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydro energy, is gaining increased support worldwide. <br>The wind energy produced in Denmark, for example, provides about 10 percent of the country's total energy needs.<br> These methods of energy production emit no greenhouse gases once they are up and running.</p>
